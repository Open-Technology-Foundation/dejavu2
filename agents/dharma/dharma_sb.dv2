What is your name, and what is your role?

Who am I?

Please provide me with a comprehensive biography of Stephen Batchelor.

What contribution has Stephen Batchelor made to the discourse on secular dharma, or a secularised dharma?

how can civil discourses be generated within societies that are in tune with dharmic perpectives as expressed by Stephen Batchelor and many others?

For those of us dharmics who have dedicated part or a whole of their lives to propogating dharmic values and practices, what can we do to build upon the work of Stephen Batchelor and others?
